The                course  introduces  students  to  the  various  ship  power  plants  in  use  and  under  development.  The                knowledge of Marine power plants as regards their respective capabilities, comparative advantages,                limitations; factors responsible for choices of each power plant as well as their applicability is to be                well  passed  on  to  students  during  lecture  sessions.  Sequel  to  the  fact  that  the  predominant  ship                power plant in the maritime industry is the Diesel Engine (DE), the course is structured to lay more                emphasis on Marine Diesel Engines.                 The course material is structured in chapters; there are Seven (7) chapters. The chapters collectively                cover the course synopses as contained in the most recently revised departmental handbook. With                successful delivery of the lectures; the course objectives would be achieved.                 At the completion of the course delivery, an assessment tool (questionnaire) will be issued to the                students to get their feedbacks on the course and the delivery method(s) employed.

Ship power plants simply refer                to the combination of components, machineries, or system to provide power (electrical, mechanical,                thermal,  solar,  nuclear,  aerodynamic  or  hydrodynamic  etc.)  on  board  ships.  The  power  made                available by the power plant can then be used for various designed purposes. One of such main                purposes  is  propulsion.  Other  purposes  are  Heating,  Ventilation  and  Air-conditioning  (HVAC),                illumination (i.e. lighting), waste treatment, hotel and accommodations, safety and security, cargo                handling etc.                 On-board ships, the predominant power plants are the propulsion plants, it is therefore reasonable to                classify ship power plants in terms of ship propulsion systems. Ship propulsion system refers to the                interconnection of various components or subsystems aimed at successful (i.e. safely and reliably)                movement of the vessel from one location to the other.  Ab-initio there were limited number of ship                propulsion systems, however, with the development in sciences; advancement in technologies and                engineering sophistication, there are several innovative ones with which a vessel can be best fitted                with depending on certain factors such as type/purpose of ship, area of operation, legal framework,                regulatory  framework,  efficiency,  cost  effectiveness,  reliability,  comfort  and  convenience,                environmental friendliness etc.                 It is imperative to mention that today’s ship propulsion is not just about successful movement of the                ship in the water, rather, it involves selection of the best possible option that guarantees safety of                lives and properties,  as well as preservation of or consciousness to the marine ecosystem.                 1.2     Types of Marine (Ship) Propulsion System                There are various types of ship propulsion systems. Some ship propulsion systems are discussed                below.                 1.2.1  Diesel Propulsion                Diesel  propulsion  system is  the  most  commonly  used  marine  propulsion  system  converting                mechanical energy from thermal forces. Diesel propulsion systems are mainly used in almost all                types of vessels along with small boats and recreational vessels.

YS Akpaba                                                                           Page 9","(b)                                        Fig. 1-1: Marine Diesel Engine propulsion configuration                 1.2.2  Wind Propulsion                Wind  propulsion  emerged  as  an  alternative  to  those  systems  which  emit  huge  quantities  of                CO2 gases in the marine atmosphere. However, the usage of wind turbine marine propulsion has not                started extensively in large commercial ships because of a requirement of constant windiness. Two                wind propulsion systems for ships that have become lately are- kite propulsion and sail propulsion                for merchant ships.

The secondary system is isolated from the primary system so that                the water in the two systems does not intermix. In the secondary system, the steam flows from the                steam generators to drive the turbine generators, which supply the ship with electricity, and to the                main propulsion turbines, which drive the propeller. After passing through the turbines, the steam is                condensed into water which is fed back to the steam generators by the feed pumps. Thus, both the                primary and secondary systems are closed systems where water is recirculated and renewed.                   Engr.

Nuclear power is particularly suitable for vessels which need to be at sea for long                periods without refueling, or for powerful submarine propulsion.

This system of ship propulsion is known as a “split-shaft                gas turbine.” The gas turbine drive shaft contains the turbine starter and the auxiliary pumps drives                for the different systems. Hot exhaust gasses from the gas turbine are fed into the power turbine.                The power turbine is much slower running than the gas turbine. It has blades and rotors shaped as                nozzles  similar  to  that  of  a  normal  steam  turbine.  The  power  turbine  output  shaft  connects  by                coupling to the gearbox incorporating a clutch which is used to engage/disengage the drive. The                drive shaft exits the gearbox at the revolutions required by either a fixed or variable pitch propeller.

Electricity is created in the                fuel cell without any combustion whatsoever. The process is clean and therefore has been regarded                as  a very important  alternative marine propulsion system.  There  are various types of propulsion                under  the  fuel  cell  propulsion  head  like  PEM  (Photon-Exchange-Membrane)  and  the  Molten-                Carbonate Systems.

Cylinders: The circular cylinders in the engine block in which the pistons reciprocate                          back and forth. The walls of the cylinder have highly polished hard surfaces.                        2. Cylinder bore (D): The nominal inner diameter of the working cylinder.                        3. Piston area (A): The area of circle of diameter equal to the cylinder bore.                        4.  Stroke  (L):  The  nominal  distance  through  which  a  working  piston  moves  between  two                          successive reversals of its direction of motion.                        5.  Dead  Centre:  The  position  of  the  working  piston  and  the  moving  parts  which  are                          mechanically  connected  to  it  at  the  moment  when  the  direction  of  the  piston  motion  is                          reversed (at either end point of the stroke).                          (a)  Bottom  dead  centre  (BDC):  Position  of  the  piston  when  the  piston  is  nearest  to  the                              crankshaft.  Some  sources  call  this  Crank-End-Dead-Center  (CEDC)  because  it  is  not                              always at the bottom of the engine. Some sources call this  point Bottom-Center (BC).                              During an engine cycle things can happen before Bottom-dead-center, bBDC or bBC, and                              after bottom-dead center, aBDC or abe.

Top because this position is at the top of most engines (not always), and dead                              because the piston stops at this point. Because in some engines top-de ad-center is not at                              the  top  of  the  engine  (e.g.,  horizontally  opposed  engines,  radial  engines,  etc.),  some                              Sources  call  this  position  Head-End-Dead-Center  (HEDC).  Some  sources  call  this                              position Top-Center (TC). When an occurrence in a cycle happens before TDC, it is often                              abbreviated bTDC or bTe.                    Engr.

Exhaust system: Flow system for removing exhaust gases from the cylinders, treating                          them, and exhausting them to the surroundings. It consists of an exhaust manifold which                          carries the exhaust gases away from the engine, a thermal or catalytic converter to reduce                          emissions,  a  muffler  to  reduce  engine  noise,  and  a  tailpipe  to  carry  the  exhaust  gases                          away from the passenger compartment.                        14.

The term \"cylinder\" is sometimes synonymous with\" combustion chamber\" (e.g.,                          \"the engine was firing on all cylinders\").                        17.  Crankcase:  Part  of  the  engine  block  surrounding  the  rotating  crankshaft.  In  many                           engines, the oil pan makes up part of the crankcase housing.                        18. Direct Injection (DI):  Fuel injection into the main combustion chamber of an engine.                          Engines have either one main combustion chamber (open chamber)                        19. Indirect Injection (IDI): Fuel injection into the secondary chamber of an engine with a                          divided combustion chamber.                        20.

Carburetor: Venturi flow device which meters the proper amount of fuel into the air                          flow by means of a pressure differential.                        30. Catalytic  converter:  Chamber  mounted  in  exhaust  flow  containing  catalytic  material                          that promotes reduction of emissions by chemical reaction.                        31. Flywheel: Rotating mass with a large moment of inertia connected to the crankshaft of                          the engine. The purpose of the flywheel is to store energy and furnish a large angular                          momentum that keeps the engine rotating between power strokes and smooths out engine                          operation.                        32. Glow plug: Small electrical resistance heater mounted inside the combustion chamber of                          many  CI  engines,  used  to  preheat  the  chamber  enough  so  that  combustion  will  occur                          when first starting a cold engine. The glow plug is turned off after the engine is started.                        33. Head: The piece which closes the end of the cylinders, usually containing part of the                          clearance volume of the combustion chamber. The head is usually cast iron or aluminum,                          and bolts to the engine block. In some less common engines, the head is one piece with                          the block. The head contains the spark plugs in SI engines and the fuel injectors in CI                          engines  and  some  SI  engines.  Most  modern  engines  have  the  valves  in  the  head,  and                          many have the camshaft(s) positioned there also (overhead valves and overhead cam).                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 18","34. Head gasket: Gasket which serves as a sealant between the engine block and head where                          they  bolt  together.  They  are  usually  made  in  sandwich  construction  of  metal  and                          composite materials.                        35. Intake manifold:  Piping system  which delivers incoming  air to  the  cylinders, usually                          made of cast metal, plastic, or composite material. In most SI engines, fuel is added to the                          air  in  the  intake  manifold  system  either  by  fuel  injectors  or  with  a  carburetor.  Some                          intake manifolds are heated to enhance fuel evaporation. The individual pipe to a single                          cylinder is called a runner.                        36. Main  bearing:  The  bearings  connected  to  the  engine  block  in  which  the  crankshaft                          rotates. The maximum number of main bearings would be equal to the number of pistons                          plus one, or one between each set of pistons plus the two ends. On some less powerful                          engines, the number of main bearings is less than this maximum.                        37. Oil pan: Oil reservoir usually bolted to the bottom of the engine block, making up part of                          the crankcase. It also acts as the oil sump for most engines.                        38. Oil pump: Pump used to distribute oil from the oil sump to required lubrication points.                          The oil pump can be electrically driven, but is most commonly mechanically driven by                          the engine. Some small engines do not have an oil pump and are lubricated by splash                          distribution.                        39. Oil sump: Reservoir for the oil system of the engine, commonly part of the                          crankcase. Some engines (aircraft) have a separate closed reservoir called a dry sump.                        40. Piston rings: Metal rings that fit into circumferential grooves around the piston and form                          a sliding surface against the cylinder walls. Near the top of the piston are usually two or                          more compression rings made of highly polished hard chrome steel. The purpose of these                          is to form a seal between the piston and cylinder walls and to restrict the high-pressure                          gases  in  the  combustion  chamber  from  leaking  past  the  piston  into  the  crankcase                          (blowby). Below the compression rings on the piston is at least one oil ring, which assists                          in lubricating the cylinder walls and scrapes away excess oil to reduce oil consumption.                        41. Push  rods:  Mechanical  linkage  between  the  camshaft  and  valves  on  overhead  valve                          engines with the camshaft in the crankcase. Many push rods have oil passages through                          their length as part of a pressurized lubrication system.                        42. Radiator: Liquid-to-air heat exchanger of honeycomb construction used to remove heat                          from the engine coolant after the engine has been cooled. The radiator is usually mounted                          in front of the engine in the flow of air as the automobile moves forward. An engine-                          driven fan is often used to increase air flow through the radiator.                  Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 19","43. Spark plug: Electrical device used to initiate combustion in an SI engine by creating a                          high-voltage discharge across an electrode gap. Spark plugs are usually made of metal                          surrounded  with  ceramic  insulation.  Some  modern  spark  plugs  have  built-in  pressure                          sensors which supply one of the inputs into engine control.                        44. Water  jacket:  System  of  liquid  flow  passages  surrounding  the  cylinders,  usually                          constructed as part of the engine block and head. Engine coolant flows through the water                          jacket  and  keeps  the  cylinder  walls  from  overheating.  The  coolant  is  usually  a  water-                          ethylene glycol mixture.                       45. Water pump Pump: Used to circulate engine coolant through the engine and radiator. It                          is usually mechanically run off of the engine.                        46. Wrist pin: Pin fastening the connecting rod to the piston (also called the piston pin or                          gudgeon pin).                 Some major terminologies of a diesel engine discussed above are illustrated Diagrammatically in                Fig. 2-1.

In a                liquid-cooled diesel, the block also provides the structure and rigid frame for the engine cylinders,                water coolant and oil passages, and support for the crankshaft and camshaft bearing.                                                                     Fig. 2-4: The cylinder Block                   2.5.2  Pistons and Rings                The piston transforms the energy of the expanding gasses into mechanical energy. The piston rides                in the cylinder liner or sleeve. The pistons are commonly made of aluminium or cast iron alloys. It                provides large bearing areas; fitted with pressure rings (to prevent blowby) and scraper rings (to aid                lubrication);  case-hardened  steel  gudgeon/piston  pin  is  fully  floating  and  is  retained  by                circlips/retaining rings. An exploded view of piston and the associated accessories is shown in Fig.                2-5.                  2.5.3  Connecting Rods                The Connecting rod connects the piston to the crankshaft. The rods are made from drop-forged,                heat-treated steel to provide the requirement strength. Each end of the rod is bored, with the smaller                top bore connecting to the piston pin (wrist pin) in the piston as shown in Fig. 2-5. The large bore                end of the rod is split in half and bolted to allow the rod to be attached to the crankshaft. Some                diesel  engine  connecting  rods  are  drilled  down  the  centre  to  allow  oil  to  travel  up  from  the                crankshaft and into the piston pin and piston for lubrication.                      Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 23","Fig. 2-5: Exploded view of Piston and accessories                  2.5.4  Crankshaft                The crankshaft transforms the linear (reciprocating) motion of the pistons into a rotational motion                that  is  transmitted  to  the  load.  Crankshafts  are  made  of  forged  steel.  The  forged  crankshaft  is                machined to produce the crankshaft bearing and connecting rod bearing surfaces. The rod journals                are  eccentric,  or  offset,  from  the  centre  of  the  crankshaft  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  2-6.  The  offset                converts  the  reciprocating  (up  and  down)  motion  of  the  piston  into  the  rotary  motion  of  the                crankshaft. The amount of offset determines the stroke (distance the piston travels) of the engine.                  The crankshaft does not ride directly on the cast iron block crankshaft supports, but rides on special                bearing materials as shown in Fig.2-6. The connecting rods also have bearings inserted between the                crankshaft and the connecting rods. The bearing material is a soft alloy of metals that provides a                replaceable  wear  surface  and  prevents  galling  between  two  similar  metals  (i.e.  crankshaft  and                connecting rod). The crankshaft is drilled with oil passages that allowed the engine to feed oil to                each of the crankshaft bearings and connecting rod bearings and up into the connecting rod itself.

Fig. 2-6: Crankshaft                  2.5.5  Camshaft                A camshaft (Fig. 2-7) is a long bar with egg-shaped eccentric lobes, one lobe for each valve fuel                injector.  Each lobe has a follower; hence, as the camshaft is rotated, the follower is forced up and                down as it follows the profile of the cam lobe. The followers are connected to the engine’s valves                and fuel injectors through various types of linkages called pushrods and rocker arms as shown in                Fig. 2-8.

The valves are mainly closed by springs.                As the valve is opened by the camshaft, it compresses the valve spring. The energy stored in the                valve spring is then used to close the valve as the camshaft lobe rotates out from under the follower.                 Considering the fact that diesel engine experiences fairly large changes in temperature (e.g. ambient                                                      0                to a normal temperature of about 190 F), its components must be designed to allow for thermal                expansion.  Therefore,  the  valves,  valve  pushrods,  and  rocker  arms  must  have  some  methods  of                allowing for the expansion. This is accomplished by the use of valve lash. Valve lash is the term                given to the “slop” of “give” in the valve train before the cam actually starts to open the valve.                 The camshaft is driven by the engine’s crankshaft through a series of gears called idler gears and                timing gears.  The gears allow the rotation of the camshaft to correspond or be in time with the                rotation of the crankshaft thereby allowing valves opening, valve closing, and injection of fuel to                occur  at  precise  intervals  as  the  piston  travels.  To  increase  the  flexibility  in  timing  the  valve                opening, valve closing, and injection of fuels, and to increase power, to reduce cost, an engine may                have one or more camshafts. Typically, in a medium to large V-types engine, each bank will have                one  or  more  camshaft  per  head.  In  large  engines,  the  intake  valves,  exhaust  valves,  and  fuel                injectors may share a common camshaft or have independent camshafts.

Chemical energy of the fuel is                first converted to thermal energy by means of combustion or oxidation with air inside the engine.                This thermal energy raises the temperature and pressure of the gases within the engine and the high-                pressure  gas  then  expands  against  the  mechanical  mechanisms  of  the  engine.  This  expansion  is                converted by the mechanical linkages of the engine to a rotating crankshaft, which is the output of                the engine. The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to a transmission and/or power train to transmit the                rotating mechanical energy to the desired final use (One end of the crankshaft is bolted to an output                shaft while the other end may be free or geared to drive camshaft, pumps or alternator). For engines                this will often be the propulsion of a vehicle (i.e. marine vessel, automobile, truck, locomotive, or                airplane). Other applications include stationary engines to drive generators (electricity generating                sets) or pumps, and portable engines for things like chain saws and lawn mowers etc.                 Piston-connecting rod type engines, industrial gas turbines, aircraft jets, firearms and rocket engines                are  classified  as  internal  combustion  engines.  The  characteristics  of  these  power  plants  are                fundamentally  different  from  those  referred  to  as  external  combustion  engines.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 27","3.2     Early History of Diesel Engine                The advent of the diesel engine started in 1892 when a German engineer, Dr. Rudolf Diesel (1858-                1913)  began  his  pioneering  investigation  on  the  reaction  of  hydrocarbon  fuel  in  a  confined  and                controlled space. The compressed air only in the space was used to achieve high temperature and                pressure before injecting fuel  at the end of compression, which gave a spontaneous ignition.  Dr                Diesel's main investigation was the injection of fuel with a pump that metered the required quantity                of fuel under controlled conditions. The success of this investigation resulted in the predominance                of the use of liquid hydrocarbon fuel in diesel engines, particularly for the large low speed types                that is  widely used in  marine application.  Early  compression ignition  engines  were noisy, large,                slow,  single-cylinder  engines.  They  were,  however,  generally  more  efficient  than  spark  ignition                engines. It was not until 1912 when Burmister and Wain put the first marine engine into operation.                Dr Hubert Akroyd Stuart of Great Britain was also known to have carried out intensive research and                development of the diesel engine.                 Since after the invention, a continuous process of development, upgrading and refinements have                been  taking  place  in  all  aspects  of  the  applications  of  the  diesel  engine  to  give  optimum                performance, economy, higher specific power output to weight ratio, and lower exhaust emissions                and noise levels.  The marine diesel engines have been improved to an extent that most medium                speed engines can now burn heavy fuel oil economically and meet the required exhaust emission                regulations.                 3.3     Classification of Internal Combustion Engines                Internal combustion engines can be classified in a number of different ways:                 1.  According to Type of Ignition                The principal distinction between the diesel and petrol engines is the mode of combustion process                taking place in their cylinders                         (a) Spark-ignition (Petrol) Engines: In the spark-ignition engine, homogeneous mixture of                        fuel  and  air  is  ignited  by  electrically  energised  spark  (from  spark  plug)  at  the  end  of  a                        compression  stroke.  The  mixture  is  compressed  to  a  designed  compression  ratio  by                        movement  of  a  piston-connecting  rod  crankshaft  mechanism  before  it  is  ignited  at  a                        predetermined  ignition  point.  When  combustion  takes  place,  the  pressure  rises  instantly                        while the mixture compression continued. Theoretically, combustion is complete before the                        piston descends and thus combustion is assumed to have taken place at constant volume.                        Hence, the process is known as constant volume or Otto cycle.                         (b) Compression-ignition (Diesel) Engine: During the combustion process in compression                        ignition engine, air alone is compressed in the cylinder to a predetermined high compression                        ratio also by movement of a piston-connecting rod crankshaft mechanism. Fuel is injected                        into the compressed air before the piston comes to top dead centre (TDC). After a 'delay                        period', ignition of the heterogeneous mixture of fuel, air and residual gases from previous                        cycle, takes place spontaneously and it is followed by intense burning. Since fuel is injected                        over  a  period,  burning  will  continue  during  the  working  stroke  of  the  cycle.  A  constant                        pressure  is  theoretically  maintained  during  the  stroke.  Hence,  the  process  is  known  as                        constant pressure or diesel cycle.                    Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 28","Fig. 3-1: Spark Ignition Engine                  2. According to Engine Cycle                        (a)  Four-Stroke  Cycle:  A  four-stroke  cycle  experiences  four  piston  movements  over  two                        engine revolutions for each cycle, in which case, a cycle is completed in four strokes made                        by the piston.                         (b) Two-Stroke Cycle: A two-stroke cycle has two piston movements over one revolution                        for each cycle. In which case, a cycle is completed in two strokes made by the piston.                                                              Fig. 3-2: Compression Ignition Engine                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 29","3.  According to Valve Location (see Fig. 3-3)                         (a) Valves in head (overhead valve), also called I Head engine.                        (b) Valves in block (flat head), also called L Head engine.                        Some historic engines with valves in block had the intake valve on one side of the cylinder                        and the exhaust valve on the other side. These were called T Head engines.                        (c) One valve in head (usually intake) and one in block, also called F Head engine; this is                        much less common.

According to Basic Design                        (a) Reciprocating: Engine has one or more cylinders in which pistons reciprocate back and                        forth.  The  combustion  chamber  is  located  in  the  closed  end  of  each  cylinder.  Power  is                        delivered to a rotating output crankshaft by mechanical linkage with the pistons.                         (b) Rotary: Engine is made of a block (stator) built around a large non-concentric rotor and                        crankshaft. The combustion chambers are built into the nonrotating block.                 5. According to Position and Number of Cylinders of Reciprocating Engines (Fig. 3-6)                        (a) Single Cylinder: Engine has one cylinder and piston connected to the crankshaft.                         (b) In-Line: Cylinders are positioned in a straight line, one behind the other along the length                        of  the  crankshaft.  They  can  consist  of  2  to  11  cylinders  or  possibly  more.  In-line  four-                        cylinder engines are very  common for automobile and other applications.  In-line six and                  Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 30","eight cylinders are historically common automobile engines. In-line engines are sometimes                        called straight (e.g., straight six or straight eight).                         (c) V Engine: Two banks of cylinders at an angle with each other along a single crankshaft.                        The angle between the banks of cylinders can be anywhere from 15° to 120°, with 60° 90°                        being common. V engines have even numbers of cylinders from 2 to 20 or more. V6s and                        V8s are common automobile engines, with V12s and V16s (historic) found in some luxury                        and high-performance vehicles.                         (d)  Opposed  Cylinder  Engine:  Two  banks  of  cylinders  opposite  each  other  on  a  single                        crankshaft  (a  V  engine  with  a  180°V).  These  are  common  on  small  aircraft  and  some                        automobiles with an even number of cylinders from two to eight or more. These engines are                        often called flat engines (e.g., flat four).                         (e)  W  Engine:  Same  as  a  V  engine  except  with  three  banks  of  cylinders  on  the  same                        crankshaft.  Not  common,  but  some  have  been  developed  for  racing  automobiles,  both                        modern and historic. Usually 12 cylinders with about a 60° angle between each bank.                         (f) Opposed Piston Engine: Two pistons in each cylinder with the combustion chamber in                        the center between the pistons. A single-combustion process causes two power strokes at the                        same time, with each piston being pushed away from the center and delivering power to a                        separate  crankshaft  at  each  end  of  the  cylinder.  Engine  output  is  either  on  two  rotating                        crankshafts or on one crankshaft incorporating complex mechanical linkage.                         (g)  Radial  Engine:  Engine  with  pistons  positioned  in  a  circular  plane  around  the  central                        crankshaft. The connecting rods of the pistons are connected to a master rod which, in turn,                        is connected to the crankshaft. A bank of cylinders on a radial engine always has an odd                        number of cylinders ranging from 3 to 13 or more. Operating on a four-stroke cycle, every                        other  cylinder  fires  and  has  a  power  stroke  as  the  crankshaft  rotates,  giving  a  smooth                        operation.  Many  medium-  and  large-size  propeller-driven  aircraft  use  radial  engines.  For                        large aircraft, two or more banks of cylinders are mounted together, one behind the other on                        a single crankshaft, making one powerful, smooth engine. Very large ship engines exist with                        up to 54 cylinders, six banks of 9 cylinders each.                 6. According to Air Intake Process                        (a) Naturally Aspirated: No intake air pressure boost system.                        (b) Turbocharged: Intake air pressure increased with the turbine-compressor driven by the                        engine exhaust gases (Fig. 3-4).                        (c) Supercharged: Intake air pressure increased with the compressor driven off of the engine                        crankshaft (Fig. 3-5).                        (d) Crankcase Compressed: Two-stroke cycle engine which uses the crankcase as the intake                        air compressor. Limited development work has also been done on design and construction                        of four stroke cycle engines with crankcase compression.                          Engr.

Some, usually large, CI engines use a combination of methane and diesel fuel. These                        are attractive in developing third-world countries because of the high cost of diesel fuel.

Thus,                a modern engine might be called a turbocharged, reciprocating, spark ignition, four-stroke cycle,                overhead valve, water-cooled, gasoline, multipoint fuel-injected, V8 automobile engine.                 3.4     Choice of Diesel Engine for Main Propulsion Plant on Ships                 The reasons for the popularity of diesel engine as marine propulsion plants are as follows:                        (a) Lower specific fuel consumption due to higher compression ratio used in the design of                           diesel engines,                        (b) Higher torque at lower speed range since there is less restriction of air at induction,                        (c) Lower exhaust temperatures,                        (d) Cylinder power output is better balanced                        (e) Lower exhaust emission of carbon monoxide                        (f) Reduced fire risk in the storage of diesel fuel                        .                Due to the requirements of higher pressures, stronger and heavier parts are used in the production of                diesel engines. For a given output, the power to weight ratio of a diesel engine is lower than that of                petrol engine.  Hence, petrol engines are rarely used for propulsion except as outboard engine in                high-speed craft. However, noise and smoke levels of diesel engines are higher than those of petrol                engines.                                  Engr.

A precise                timing is required for a valve to start opening from its seat to a fully opened position and allow                maximum flow of gas before it starts to close.                 The  points  at  which  the  valves  of  an  engine  are  arranged  to  open  and  close  in  relation  to  the                position of the piston vary considerably with different engine designs and are governed largely by                the speed at which the particular engine will normally operate. It is generally true to say that the                valves of a fast running engine will open earlier in relation to the piston's position than will those of                a slow running engine. The information necessary to obtain design settings for valve timing can be                found in maker's handbook in form of either timing diagram shown in fig. 3-7 or in tabular form.                    Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 36","The point at which injection commences in a compression ignition engine is normally shown on the                timing diagram although the injection timing is normally a separate operation. The timing governs                the amount of constant volume or pressure combustion and peak pressures.                 3.5.1   Valve Timing of Four-stroke Engines                                                    Fig. 3-7: Actual Four (4) Stroke Engine Valve Timing Diagram                 The  opening  and  closing  of  the  valves  of  an  engine  are  normally  controlled  by  a  cam-operated                mechanism, which in turn is driven by the crankshaft. It therefore follows that if the camshaft is                timed to rotate in the correct direction in relationship to the crankshaft, the valves will open and                close in similar manner to the position of the piston if the tappet clearances are correct.  In most                design the cams are integral with the crankshaft and therefore if the engine is timed correctly to                No.1 cylinder it follows that other cylinders will be timed correctly.                 In practice, the inlet valve opens before TDC and closes after BDC for the following reasons:                (a)     To ensure that by the time the piston is on its downward stroke the valve is fully open and                        does not cause any restriction to the incoming charge.                (b)     To allow the first part of the incoming charge to assist in the scavenging of the cylinder.                (c)     To allow the velocity of the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder to assist for a longer period,                        in the induction of the fresh charge which assist in piston crown and exhaust valve cooling.                (d)     To allow the maximum possible amount of fresh charge to be induced. The charge does not                        move into the cylinders as quickly as the piston is moving down the cylinder and this creates                        a slight depression immediately above the piston for natural-aspiration engine. By keeping                        the  inlet  valve,  open  after  BDC  charge  will  continue  to  enter  the  cylinder  to  fill  the                        depression even though the piston is moving up the cylinder.                 Also the exhaust valve opens before BDC and closes after TDC for the   following reasons:                (a)     To allow the exhaust gases to start moving out of the cylinder while they still have pressure                        (preliminary exhaust). This causes an ejector effect which assists in extracting the remaining                        residual gases in addition to their being displaced by rising piston.                  Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 37","(b)    To allow the first part of the charge to flow from the inlet valve (which has opened early) to                        pass across the top of the piston and displace the last of the exhaust gases to complete the                        scavenge operation.                 3.5.2   Valve Timing of Two-stroke Engines                In the two-stroke cycle engine, the periods of opening and closing inlet and exhaust ports or valves                present a difficult problem. In  cross and loop scavenge system as shown in Figure 9, ports cut in                the cylinder walls will be uncovered exactly the same period of crank movement before BDC as                they will be closed after BDC. Thus if the inlet and exhaust ports are arranged to open early, they                must close late. Since it is desirable to open the exhaust ports early to allow the gases moving out of                the  cylinder,  no  compression  of  the  fresh  charge  can  take  place  until  the  exhaust  port  is  closed                again. If the inlet port is open early to get the fresh charge moving into the cylinder it will not close                until the upward stroke by which time the suction caused by the piston will have ceased and the                rising  piston  will  tend  to  displace  some  of  the  fresh  charge  air.  Optimum  timing  is  therefore,                necessary. In a uniflow scavenge system; a valve in the cylinder head is used for exhausting. This                simplifies the problem of valve and port opening times.                 In most design, the exhaust port opens a little later than is desirable and therefore closes earlier.                This allows a longer period for the power stroke for compression but leads to poor scavenge and                lower volumetric efficiency. The inlet port opens after the exhaust port, closes before it, and thus                leads to a shorter period for induction. Due to the long delay period, an appreciable part of the fresh                charge is lost through the exhaust port. This is not a draw back in the diesel engine since air alone is                being  lost,  but  in  the  petrol  engine,  fuel  will  be  lost  during  this  period  leading  to  high  fuel                consumption and a risk of burning in the exhaust manifold.

These are:                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 38","3.6.1   Return Flow (Port) Scavenging                The return flow scavenging system can also be subdivided as follows:                 (a) Cross Flow (simple loop)                                                                                 Fig. 3-9: Scavenging systems of two-stroke engines                 The cross flow scavenging system shown in Fig.3-9(a) is widely used in low power output spark-                ignition and compression ignition engines. The scavenging air is admitted into the cylinder through                ports occupying part of the circumference of the cylinder walls.                 The burnt gases are expelled through identical exhaust ports, which are situated slightly higher than                the scavenging ports at the opposite side of the cylinder walls. Hence the exhaust ports are opened                earlier than the scavenge ports as the piston moves downwards. This ensures a considerable amount                of the burnt gases to be reduced to the pressure of the scavenge air in the receiver before the start of                the  next  scavenging  process.  The  crankcase  and  the  underside  of  the  engine  piston  act  as  a                scavenging pump in this type of scavenging system.                     Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 39","(b) Full Loop Flow                 This system is used in high power output marine diesel engines. In this type shown in Fig.3-9(b),                the  exhaust  ports  are  situated  above  the  scavenging  ports  that  permits  locating  the  scavenge  air                receiver and the exhaust manifold on the same side of the engine.                 As the piston moves downwards the exhaust ports are uncovered and preliminary discharge of the                burnt gases takes place. When the scavenge ports are uncovered, the flow of the scavenge air passes                along  the  contour  of  the  cylinder  making  a  full  loop  with  both  ends  located  at  one  side  of  the                cylinder.                 As the piston starts moving upwards and covers the scavenge ports the scavenging process ceases                and the air charge begins to escape through the exhaust ports. Most engines are fitted with rotating                automatic control valves behind the exhaust ports for closing the latter before the scavenge ports are                fully  covered  thus  eliminating  loss  of  charge  air  and  the  cylinders  can  be  additionally  pressure                charged.                 3.6.2  Uniflow Scavenge System                 There are also two types of uniflow scavenging system. These are:                 (a)  Uniflow Valve Scavenging                The uniflow valve scavenging system shown in Fig. 3-9 (c) is used in high-power output low-speed                marine diesel engine and in light high-speed engines. The scavenge air enters the cylinders through                ports located around the entire periphery of the cylinders and the burnt gases are expelled via the                valve(s) located in the cylinder head or cover. The scavenge air passes through the cylinders in a                straight flow. To ensure preliminary exhausting of the gases, the exhaust valve(s) open before the                scavenge ports. When the cylinder is being charged with additional air, these valves are closed. This                type of scavenge system is used in the Sulzer RTA series and the Burmister and Wain-MAN diesel                engines.                 (b) Uniflow Port Scavenging                This type shown in Fig.3-9 (d) is used in opposed piston or double acting two-stroke cycle engines.                The scavenge air enters through the lower ports and the burnt gases are exhausted through the upper                ports or vice versa. The scavenge ports are located tangentially to the cylinder circumference and                somewhat inclined to its axis. This creates spiral motion of the air charge and improves scavenging                of the cylinders.                               Engr.

The cycle is described as follows: from stage.                1 - 2  air is compressed isentropically,                2 - 3    heat Q  is added at constant volume while the pressure increases from P  to P                                                                                                   3,                              23                                                              2                3 - 4    heat Q  is transferred at constant pressure while volume increases from V  to V ,                              34                                                               3    4                4 - 5    air is expanded isentropically to the original volume, and                5 - 1    heat Q  is rejected at constant volume until the cycle is completed.                              51                 The temperatures at the various stages are expressed as follows:                                                             V    − 1   − 1                                                                                                                              T                                                                                                                 T 2  = T 1   1    = r                                4 ( − 17 )                                                                      1 c                                                           V 2                  And                                                           P                                                                      r                                                   T 3  = T 2    3     = T 2 p                        4 ( − 18 )                                                            P 2                                                     P                           Where  rp  is  pressure ratio  3                                                     P 2                   Substituting for T2 from equation 4-17 into equation 4-18 gives                                                                  r                                                          T 3  = T 1 p r c  − 1                          4 ( − 19 )                 The temperature at the end of constant heat addition is obtained as                                                               V                                                          T  =  4  T                                    4 ( −  20 )                                                           4                                                               V 3   3                Substituting for T3 from equation 4-19 in equation 4-20, gives                                                          T 4  = T 1 p r c  − 1                          4 ( − 21 )                                                                r                                                           V    V                The volume expansion (cut off) ratio           4  =  4  =      since   V = V                                                                                     2                                                                                3                                                          V 3  V 2                                            V     V   V                     Also                             4  =    4    2     =                                                                                             V 1   V 2  V 1    r c                 SinceV1 = V5, using isentropic expansion process, the final temperature is obtained                                               V    − 1          − 1                                                                                                                                                    T 5  = T 4   4     =  T 4                                    4 ( −  22 )                                                                r                                               V 5            c                  Engr.

However, in practice it is not such a simple comparison as                design limitations, performance requirement and friction alter the basis for comparison. The diesel                engine employs higher compression ratios than the gasoline engine. The amount of constant volume                combustion may be varied by altering the point of ignition up to the limit of detonation or pre-                ignition.

Variation of the point of fuel                injection determines the amount of constant pressure or volume combustion. Advancing the point                gives increased constant volume and decreased constant pressure combustion giving peak pressures,                more work output, higher powers and efficiency. The maximum thermal efficiency occurs when the                heat addition takes place at the highest possible temperature and is rejected at the lowest possible                temperature. For some small high-speed diesel engines, all the heat may be added at the constant                volume before the piston reaches TDC giving greater efficiency and very high power output.                 4.1.4   Mean Effective Pressure                The mean effective pressure of a theoretical cycle is expressed as:                                                          W                                                 P   =                                                  ( 4 −  28 )                                                   m                                                       V 1  −V 2                          Where W = Net work output                 4.2     Actual Cycles of Internal Combustion Engines                There are two types of actual cycles:                                   i.  Four-Stroke cycle                                  ii.  Two-Stroke cycle                In reciprocating internal combustion engines, the working cycle can be accomplished either in four                or two strokes of the piston, both cases are discussed below.                 4.2.1   Four-stroke Cycle                In the four stroke cycle engines, all the four processes that constitute the four strokes occupy two                complete revolutions of the crankshaft as illustrated in Figures 4-5 and 4-6.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 47","Fig. 4-6:  The four-stroke cycle sequence                  (a) Induction (Suction) Stroke                During induction stroke, inlet valve opens and exhaust valve closes. As the piston now descends, it                draws a fresh charge into the cylinder. The charge is air only in diesel engines while it is a mixture                of fuel and air in petrol engines. Since the piston movement is not uniform the pressure will also                vary. The suction pressure is usually below atmospheric in naturally aspirated engine.                 (b) Compression (\& Fuel Injection) Stroke                 At the instance of compression, the piston passes bottom dead centre (BDC) and rises towards top                dead centre (TDC).  When the inlet valve is closed, the charge air is compressed to an approximate                range of 16 -22:1  (7 - 9:1 for petrol engines).  Fuel is injected into the hot compressed air and                ignition of the charge occurs before the end of compression stroke so that 'complete' combustion of                fuel may be achieved.                 The  compression  process  instead  of  being  reversible  and  adiabatic  will  be  irreversible  due  to                frictional effect and heat transfer from cylinder walls to the charge in the early stages of combustion                followed  by  heat  transfer  in  the  reverse  direction  at  later  stages  of  compression.  When  fuel  is                injected at a predetermined point before TDC, it will mix with the hot compressed air and ignition                occurs. The mixture burns at a certain finite rate after a delay period. The piston travels a certain                part of its down stroke from TDC as combustion process still continues and the cylinder volume                increases while the pressure rises, following a complex curve.                 (c)  Power (Ignition \& Expansion) Stroke                The process of expansion is normally accompanied by vigorous heat transfer from very hot burnt                gases to relatively low temperature cylinder walls. The expanding burnt gases push down the piston                and  hence  turn  the  crankshaft.  The  expansion  follows  a  polytropic  process  and  ends  at  a  point                before BDC when exhaust valve opens. Since the fuel is metered and injected into the cylinders at a                controlled rate, the pressure will rise at a constant rate to give smooth combustion. The evaluation                of the rate of pressure rise is a fundamental engine design factor. The choice of heat release pattern                depends on factors, which include combustion chamber geometry, engine size and speed.                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 48","The expansion process differs more remarkably from the adiabatic and reversible process due to the                intense heat transfer from gas to cylinder walls.  The variation of the specific heat of exhaust gases                is  associated  with  higher  gas  temperature  and  the  heterogeneous  composition  of  the  product  of                combustion.                 Heat  losses  in  actual  cycle  can  be  reasonably  calculated  with  computer  simulation  models  of                combustion  cycle.  Empirical  equations  exist  to  determine  heat  transfer  coefficients,  which  are                related to pressures and temperatures of combustion gases of engines.                 (d) Exhaust Stroke                The process of expulsion of combustion products from the cylinder starts from a point before the                piston reached the BDC position. Initially preliminary exhaust takes place at the point “EVO” in                Fig.4-5 with the pressure falling sharply. When the piston is moving in its upward stroke, it expels                the rest of exhaust gases from the cylinder at a pressure higher than atmospheric.                 The area on the PV diagram, Fig.4-5 contained within the process lines gives the work done in the                cycle.  The upper part of the diagram (upper loop) produces positive work output whereas the lower                part of the diagram (lower loop) produces negative work output.  The network output of the whole                cycle is the difference between the two loops.                 4.2.2  Two-stroke Cycle                In the two-stroke cycle, Induction, compression, power and exhaust are arranged to take place in                two strokes of the piston that is one revolution of the crankshaft as illustrated in Figures 4-7 and 4-8                                         Fig. 4-7: Pressure-volume diagram of actual Two Stroke                     Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 49","Fig.4-8: The Two-stroke cycle sequence                      Ports cut into cylinder walls are used for induction and exhausting while some designs use valve                for exhausting. The process is as follows:                 (a)     When the piston is moving upwards, it covers the inlet ports while the exhaust valve(s) or                        ports are closed and compression of the charge air commences. Before TDC, fuel is injected                        into the cylinder, which now contains highly compressed air.                (b)     When ignition occurs, a further rise in temperature and pressure due to combustion, forces                        the  piston  down  the  cylinder.  Before  BDC  is  reached,  the  exhaust  ports  or  valve(s)  are                        opened and the gases leave the cylinder at high velocity.                (c)     Further  downward  movement  of  the  piston  uncovers  the  inlet  ports  and  allows  a  fresh                        charge of air to be drawn in by the movement of the piston and the depression caused by the                        exhaust gases leaving the cylinder at high velocity.                (d)     The piston moving upwards again covers the ports and then compresses the charge air in                        readiness for the next cycle.                 Hence,  part  of  every  down  stroke  of  the  piston  is  the  power  stroke  and  part  of  every  upstroke                compresses the charge air. Thus, there is one power stroke during each complete revolution of the                engine.                 In Fig.4-7, the PV diagram shows that exhaust of combustion products begins at point 7 and last                through 0 to 1.  The exhaust period from point 7 to 0 is known as preliminary exhaust and it is the                period when the pressure within the cylinder drops to the level of scavenge pressure in the scavenge                air receiver.  Scavenging of the cylinder begins from point 0 when the piston exposes the ports in                the  cylinder  walls  to  an  air  receiver  and  the  cylinder  supplied  with  fresh  air.  For  a  two-stroke                engine, scavenge pump is usually fitted to supply air to the receiver.                 The main disadvantages of the two-stroke engine are:                (a)     Poor volumetric efficiency.                (b)     No separate induction and exhaust stroke.                (c)     Power loss due to early opening of exhaust port.                (d)     Power from engine is required to drive scavenge pump or blower.                  Engr.

(a)     In  the  cylinder  head  of  a  petrol  engine,  a  spark  plug  is  fitted  and  spark  is  produced  at                        controlled intervals to ignite the compressed air-fuel mixture.                (b)     With the petrol engine, air-fuel mixture is induced into the cylinders through a carburettor.                        The engine is regulated by throttling the air passing through the carburettor.                (c)     With diesel engine air alone is supplied to the cylinders.                (d)     Combustion in the diesel engine begins spontaneously after injectors fitted in the cylinder                        head supply fuel at predetermined intervals.                (e)     Diesel  engine  is  more  robust  due  to  the  higher  pressures  it  develops  when  compared  to                        petrol engines.                   EXAMPLES                 Example 4-1                                                                                     3                In a diesel cycle, air was compressed from an initial state of 0.875 m , 1.0 bar and temperature of                                               3                   o                25 C to a volume of 0.073 m .

During combustion, part of the energy                released is converted to mechanical work; part leaves the cylinder in the exhaust gases while the                rest  is  lost  through  heat  transfer  from  the  walls  of  the  cylinder  to  a  cooling  medium.    For  the                purpose of this course and in this chapter, only the mechanical work output produced as a result of                combustion is covered herein.                 5.2     Indicated Power Output                The power developed in the cylinder of an engine during combustion is known as the indicated                power. To determine the indicated power, indicator diagram as shown in Fig. 5-1 is obtained for                each cylinder and the area of the diagram taken with an instrument called planimeter is used for                calculation of the indicated power.                 The  general  thermodynamic  relationship  is  applied  to  the  combustion  process  of  a  two  or  four-                stroke diesel engine.  Using the first law of thermodynamics to express the law of conservation of                energy in a closed period, for a reversible process, the non-flow energy equation is expressed as:                                              dE  = dQ   − dW                                               5 ( −  ) 1                 For an increment in crank angle (d) equation 2.1 is given as:                                               mde  =  dQ  −  dW                                            5 ( −  ) 2                                                d     d      d                        Where    m =   mass of the cylinder contents                                      de =   change in specific internal energy of the  cylinder contents                                        d =   change in crank angle degrees                                     dQ =   change in heat transfer from the cylinder walls                                      W =   change in work energy                 If the combustion process is considered adiabatic, then the heat transfer from the cylinder walls to                the cooling medium represented by dQ/d is zero and the energy equation 5-2 is simply expressed                as:                                             mde   =   −  dW                                              (5−    ) 3                                            d            d                  The  indicated  mean  effective  pressure,  P   has  fundamental  significance  in  determination  of  the                                                          i                work output.

For                medium and low speed engine using heavy fuel oil, it is also known as specific fuel oil consumption                (s.f.o.c.). High thermal efficiency depends upon the achievement of low specific fuel consumption                over the full operating range of the engine. While attainment of low specific fuel is desirable for                operational  economy,  it  must  not  be  sacrificed  for  lower  amount  of  exhaust  gas  energy,  which                should be available to cater for the requirements of auxiliary power plants and heating services.                 Low fuel consumption has nearly reached its limits for the near future with the present available                technology.  Only  minor  improvement  can  be  expected  without  sacrificing  other  operational                benefits.  The  potential  for  the  improvement  from  stroke-bore  ratio,  increase  in  scavenging                efficiency  and  emulsification  is  still  under  intensive  investigation.  Generally  specific  fuel                consumption is determined by the expression:                                             mf     3600                                             .f s  . .c  =  kg / kW  −   h                              (5− 13 )                                                 W                         Where:                                      mf   = fuel consumption    Kg/sec                                      W    =  W    or   W                                               i                                                       b                     Engr.

The reason is that the                engine uses part of the energy for main useful work and other minor work for operation of pumps                connected to the engine while the rest of the energy is consumed in overcoming frictional resistance                in bearings and between piston rings and walls.

These losses are caused by friction                arising from, the following:                (a)     All moving components of the engine and                (b)     Power required to drive pumps, compressors, fans, alternators etc.                In normal engine operation the mechanical efficiency increases with engine load.                 5.7     Thermal Efficiency                The rate of energy supplied by the combustion of fuel is expressed as:                              Q   = m   .

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 63","5.10  Factors Influencing Engine Power Output                The main factors that govern the indicated and brake power output of an engine are:                  5.10.1  Number and Dimension of Cylinders                The indicated power output of an engine may be increased by increasing the bore and stroke; but                such  increases  results  in  greater  inertia  forces  of  the  reciprocating  masses  (the  pistons  and                connecting rods). Also large bore will lower the cooling effect on the piston and valves thereby                reducing the volumetric efficiency and subsequently the indicated power output.                 An increase in piston stroke and the stroke to bore (S/D) ratio, keeping other engine dimensions                unchanged leads to higher mean piston speed that reduces volumetric efficiency.  Therefore, it is                more purposeful to increase the total piston displacement of an engine by adding more cylinders                than by increasing cylinder dimensions.                 In  marine  diesel  engines  as  many  as  12  cylinders  can  be  used  in  in-line  engines  and  up  to  24                cylinders  in  'V'  type  engines.  The  choice  of  the  number  of  cylinders  requires  consideration  for                engine room space, inertia forces of the engine, frequency of engine load changes and the necessity                for starting the engine from any position of its crankshaft. From the last requirement, it follows that                diesel engine started by means of compressed air must have at least four cylinders if two-stroke and                at least six cylinders if they are four-stroke engines.                 The higher the value of stroke to bore ratio (S/D), the greater the total height of the engine.                         For:    low-speed engine S/D range is     -    1.4  -  2.2                                  medium-speed engine                -    1.0  -   1.5                                  high-speed  engine                     -    0.95(1.0)   -  1.3                 5.10.2  Number of Stroke per Cycle                Engine  power  output  rises  with  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  stroke  required  per  cycle.  Thus,                theoretically a two-stroke engine should be twice as powerful as four-stroke one with identical bore                diameter, stroke, number of cylinders and speed. A two-stroke engine has a lower value of charge                efficiency  due  to  inferior  scavenging  process  and  higher  air  temperature  at  the  beginning  of                compression stroke. The loss of a portion of piston stroke occupied by scavenging ports results in a                lower indicated thermal efficiency due to less perfect combustion. For these reasons, the indicated                power output of a two-stroke engine is not twice that of a four- stroke. It is approximately 1.75 to                1.85 times greater.                 5.10.3  Engine Speed Factor                 The brake power output of an engine should rise in direct proportion to engine speed (rev/min) and                therefore to the mean piston speed. A rise in speed however results in increase in hydrodynamic                resistance of the inlet and exhaust system that reduces the volumetric efficiency. Also increase in                engine speed impairs the mixing process of fuel and air in the cylinder and thus affects the process                of combustion, and reduces the thermal efficiency and air-fuel ratio.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 64","5.10.4  Hydrodynamic Factors                The degree of air utilization in the diesel engine is an important factor in design consideration. For a                given amount of air in the combustion chamber, the more fuel that can be burnt within the smoke                limit, the greater the indicated power and thermal efficiency. To achieve optimum operation of a                diesel engine, the AFR would be weaker than stochiometric. Air utilization is influenced largely by                the degree of air movement. Swirl and turbulence affect the air utilization in addition to higher air                velocities  in  the  combustion  chamber.  These  factors  depend  on  the  design  of  the  combustion                chamber, its operating and working conditions.                 5.10.5  Thermodynamic and Chemical Factors                Thermodynamic  and  chemical  factors  bear  significant  influence  on  engine  performance  but  in  a                variety of ways. The influence of lower calorific value is evident in power output and specific fuel                consumption. The stochiometric air-fuel ratio, the excess air and the thermal efficiency depend on                other factors such as the type of engine and its operating conditions.                  5.10.6  Efficiency Factor                The mechanical efficiency of an engine rises with the reduction of losses caused by friction and the                loss  of  power  in  driving  engine  auxiliary  machines  such  as  scavenge  pumps,  compressors,                lubricating oil and fresh water circulating pumps etc.                 5.11    Effects of Operating Conditions on Engine Combustion                The combustion rate in diesel engines, as well as the rate of pressure rise, depends greatly on the                design of the combustion chamber and injection system. In practice, the design of these elements                varies  widely  and  it  is  therefore  more  difficult  to  generalize  trends  in  the  type  of  engine.  The                following effects are for general guidance.                 5.11.1  Injection Timing                Optimum timing of the combustion process is essential in diesel engine operation. In practice, to                attain  the  maximum  indicated  mean  effective  pressure  and  maximum  efficiency,  the  injection                                                                         0                timing should be adjusted to give peak pressure at about 15  after TDC.                 Early or late injection gives a very high rate of pressure rise resulting in a long delay period. The                optimum injection of fuel is usually obtained at a point before TDC and few degrees after which is                followed by combustion period and power stroke.                 5.11.2  Engine Speed                                                                                            o                Engine speed is not affected by ignition delay period since the delay angle ( CA) varies with the                speed. However, other factors such as volumetric efficiency and spray characteristics can change                with  engine  speed.  In  most  cases,  however,  increasing  engine  speed  has  caused  higher  rate  of                pressure rise and higher maximum  pressure and this  has caused difficulties  in  high-speed diesel                engine development. To prevent the delay angle becoming too great, fuels of high ignition quality                and reduced ignition delay are specified for high-speed engines.                 5.11.3 Fuel-Air Ratio                No  low  limit  on  the  overall  AFR  seems  to  be  imposed  by  combustion  characteristics,  because                burning  occurs  in  small  elements  at  local  fuel-air  ratios  within  the  usual  combustion  range.                    Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 65","Difficulty that could be experienced at very low overall fuel-air ratios is that of maintaining good                spray characteristics with the small amounts of fuel involved.                 A limit on the maximum AFR, however, is set by incomplete combustion accompanied by a smoky                exhaust; referred to as the smoke limit. This arises from an appreciable fraction of the injected fuel                that fails to find the necessary oxygen for combustion and passes out of the cylinder as exhaust gas                and unburned fuel. This is due to poor mixing and air utilisation in the combustion chamber. One of                the best measures of the quality of a diesel combustion system is the AFR at which smoke becomes                pronounced. The higher this ratio, the better is the mixing process and the higher the mean effective                pressure. Maximum pressures in the cylinders fall steadily with decreasing AFR.                 5.11.4 Compression Ratio                Fig. 5-3 shows the typical effect of compression ratio on the pressure-crank angle diagram when                injection  timing,  speed  and  fuel  quality  are  held  constant.  The  delay  period  is  reduced  with                increasing compression ratio. In practice, the higher the compression ratio, the higher will be the                engine friction and torque required for starting.                                              Fig. 5-3: Effect of compression ratio on the pressure-crank angle diagram                  5.11.5 Delay Period                In most cases, attempts have been directed towards reducing the ignition delay period since it is an                important factor when considering the rate of pressure rise and hence combustion noise. If the rate                of  vaporisation  of  fuel  is  kept  constant,  the  rate  of  pressure  rise  is  linearly  related  to  the  delay                period (that is the rate of pressure rise increases as the delay period becomes longer).                 5.11.6  Firing Angle                The firing angle is the interval in the cycle when ignition starts for each cylinder. For any number                                                                                            760 0                of cylinders, the  firing  angle or interval  during crankshaft rotation will be       for four-stroke                                                                                                                          360 0                engine and         for two-stroke engines (where “s”  is the number of  cylinders). The  greater the                                              number of cylinders used, the more even the torque applied to the crankshaft will be.                     Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 66","5.11.6.1   Firing Angle for “Inline” Engine                The firing angle for an in-line engine is obtained as follows:                                                                                     o                                                                         o                        4-cylinder, four-stroke, the firing angle will be 720 /4    =   180                                                                        o                                                                                    o                         4-cylinder, two-stroke, the firing angle will be 360 /4     =   90                For an even number of cylinders, two pistons will be at TDC together, one at the beginning of the                induction stroke while the other is at the start of the power stroke. The order in which cylinders fire                is dependent upon the following factors:                (a)     The breathing capacity of the induction system, especially spark-ignition engines.                (b)     The elimination of torsional vibration in the crankshaft.                 Typical firing order of 4 and 6-cylinder engines are:                        4-cylinder engine      1, 3, 2, 4           or       1, 3, 4, 2                            6-cylinder engine     1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5    or       1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4                 5.11.6.2   Firing Angle for “Vee” Engine                In the determination of the firing intervals, the angle of inclination between the cylinders' banks                must be considered and is obtained as follows for a four-stroke engine:                                                          720  o                                                      =                                                  (5− 39 )                                                              S                 Where:     S   =   number of cylinders in a bank                 The firing order  =  'Vee' angle followed by ( - 'Vee' angle)                                                                       o                 Example: The firing order for a V12 engine having a 45 design angle of 'V' is obtained as follows:                                             760 0        o                                                          =      =    120                                               6                                                                    o                                                              o                                                         o                                                                        o                                                                                 o                                                                             o                Hence the firing order is 45(120 - 45) = 45 , 75 , 45 , 75 , 45 , 75  etc.                 The angle of the 'Vee' is usually dependent upon a required application of the engine and design                feature such as placement of components in the 'Vee' space.                 Identification of banks and cylinders is made in accordance with BS 1599 and 1949. The standard                specifies 'A' for left hand bank and 'B' for right hand bank, viewing engine from the free end                cylinders. Numbering of the cylinders is also done from the free end.                  5.11.7  Maximum Continuous Rating                An engine develops a maximum brake power output known as maximum continuous rating (MCR)                when it is operating at 100% marine rated brake mean effective pressure and 100% rated engine                speed (rev/min). Maximum continuous ratings specification depends on the engine manufacturer.                 For  Sulzer  engine:  to  change  from  MCR  I  to  MCR  II  requires  alteration  in  the  turbocharger                performance,  piston  position  and  to  change  to  economy  rating  propeller  characteristics  (ERP)                requires  alteration  in  the  turbocharger  performance,  fuel  injection  timing  and  piston  position.                Caterpillar engine rating ranges from continuous rating A to E depending on the type of vessel and                duration of operation. When a vessel is designed for heavy duty service and is an ocean going one,                such as freighter or tug boat, it is given an A rating.

The  energy  is  liberated  from  the  changes  that  occur  in  the                electron bonding arrangement of the fuel and oxygen molecules.                 In internal combustion engines, the process of combustion occurring in the combustion chamber                ensures  the  minimum  possible  consumption  of  fuel-air  mixture  to  give  maximum  economy  and                power of the engine at a given speed and load operation.  The process of combustion satisfies the                following requirements:                (a)     A steady rise of the gas pressure in the cylinder at a rate providing for smooth operation of                        the engine,                (b)     The  temperature  and  pressure  of  the  gases  must  not  exceed  the  thermal  loading  that  is                        consistent with the strength of the cylinder liner, walls and head; piston and valves,                (c)     Achievement  of  complete  combustion  to  avoid  unburned  fuel  which  may  cause  carbon                        deposits and smoky exhaust.                        The process may be considered in the two following perspectives:                        (a)    From the view point of thermodynamics, characterized by the variation of pressure,                               temperature and heat release, and                        (b)    From the consideration of the dynamics of the gases and flame propagation in the                               combustion chamber.                        However,  both  aspects  of  the  process  are  interrelated  and  considered  together  and  thus                characterize the complex nature of combustion process in internal combustion engine.                        In evaluating the process of combustion, the following factors are considered:                ➢       physical and chemical properties of fuel,                ➢       combustion reactions,                ➢       the conservation of energy and mass,                ➢       the principle of conservation of chemical species and an equation of state.                  6.2    Fuels                Fuels are classified according to the phase in which they exist i.e. solid, liquid or gaseous phase.                The chemical structures of gaseous fuels (e.g. methane, liquefied petroleum gas) are the simplest.                The  molecular  structures  of  liquid  fuels  are  more  complex  while  those  of  solid  are  highly                complicated and not well understood.  All fuels consist mainly hydrogen and carbon atoms, and the                chemical structure of their molecules influences the rate of combustion and heat release.                 6.2.1  Refinery Process                In a refinery, a distillation process is utilized in the production of the various types of fuel. A simple                refining process is shown in Fig. 6-1. Briefly, crude oil normally stored in settling tanks is heated in                                                            o                a  preheater  (1)  to  approximately  350  –  370 C  to  vaporize  it,  after  water,  sand  and  other  heavy                impurities have been separated out.                 Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 72","(1)  and (5) - Preheaters at 1.0 bar;    (2), (4), (7) and (9) -  Distillation columns                             (3)- Preheater at 0.1 bar;   (6) - Cracking column   (8) - Preheater at 17 bar                                                Fig. 6-1: A simple fuel refining process                 The heated crude oil is then pumped to fractionizing or distilling columns (2), (4), (7) and (9) made                up  of  vertical  condensers  which  give  a  temperature  gradient.    the  temperature  is  highest  at  the                bottom  and  lowest  at  the  uppermost  part  of  the  distilling  plant.  As  the  vapours  rise,  they  are                sequentially  condensed  at  the  various  levels  of  the  horizontal  partitions  of  the  column.  The                condensate is drawn off as distillates at different stages of the column according to their boiling                points.  The vapour which is not condensed leaves the top as petroleum gases. This is followed by                gasoline, naphtha, kerosene and a middle distillate known as gas oil.                 The  last  product  of  the  crude  oil  at  the  bottom  which  could  not  evaporate  after  the  distillate  is                residual fuel. In order to obtain larger quantities of valued fuel that is possible from the refining                process of crude oil, a number of complex refinery techniques have been developed.  In a simple                process, up to 45% residual fuel oil and other residuals such as asphalt and tar can be produced.                The amount of residual fuel that can remain depends to a large extent on the physical properties of                the  crude  oil  that  is  being  processed  and  the  refinery  process.  The  use  of  vacuum-distillation                technique is known to increase distillate production and hence decrease the amount of residual fuel                left.  In the refinery process, if more of the lighter fuels are produced, the residual fuel becomes                more viscous and heavier. All the contaminants in the crude oil such as sulphur, refinery fines and                other metals will be concentrated in the residual fuel oil thus making it difficult to treat before using                as fuel.                 Residual fuel is normally used for heating purposes and in low and medium speed diesel engines.                Most medium speed engines now run satisfactorily on heavier distillate fuels and blends of distillate                and residual fuels oil or diesel.  Some engines now run on straight residual fuel of high viscosity                after adequate treatment. High speed engines run mainly on diesel or blends of diesel and residual                fuel oil.                      Engr.

Diesel fuel takes various colours and has very strong offensive odour.                 Density                The density of fuel is one of the requirements in the specification of bunker (fuel) quality and is                usually  measured  by  means  of  an  instrument  called  hydrometer.    The  instrument  has  a  fine                                                                                           3                graduation  which  shows  only  densities  in  the  range  of  0.8  and  1.0  g/cm .    Since  temperature                influences  the  density  of  a  fluid,  any  measured  density  is  usually  corrected  to  a  reference                                  o                temperature of 15 C. The density at any other temperature ( ) can be obtained in a given chart for                                                                                            the fuel or corrected as follows:                                                                                                                  15  =  (  − 15)                                    (6-1)                                                                   Where:                                                                   o                          =  density at the prevailing temperature, T  C                                                                                                          o                         = coefficient of expansion (for mineral oil = 0.00075 per  C)                 If the density of a fuel oil is so high that a hydrometer does not sink sufficiently, a pycnometer is                used  to  determine  the  density  by  weighing.  The  accurate  measurement  of  density  in  the                determination of fuel consumption of an engine is very necessary.                 Viscosity                The resistance of a fluid to flow as a result of the relative motion of its molecules due to internal                shear stress opposing the motion is known as viscosity. It is a measure of the thickness or lightness                of the fluid. Viscosity is usually determined by a viscometer which measures the time taken for a                reference sample of the fluid to flow through a calibrated orifice at a given temperature and can be                specified as Absolute or Kinematic.                 Absolute viscosity which is also known as Dynamic Viscosity is essentially a positive quantity and                is dependent on temperature. The unit of this viscosity is called the poise with a symbol h and its                dimensions are:                                                  2                               Force .

Fuel quality is often referred in terms of one of the commercial viscosity                measurement and the kinematic viscosity is mostly used.                 The most common of these measurements are:                               Redwood No. 1 (in the United Kingdom)                               Saybolt Universal (in the United States of America)                               Engler (in Germany and other European countries)                 Carbon Residue                If fuel is taken with a large amount of residues, an incomplete combustion and the formation of                solid carbon deposit may result. The tendency of a fuel to form carbon (coke) is represented by                residue number. Carbon residue is thus defined as the percentage of carbon remaining after heating                a known quantity of fuel in a corradson crucible without access air.                 Cloud Point                Fuels have the characteristics of crystallization at certain temperatures. The temperature at which                fuel crystallizes to form paraffin wax is called cloud point.  Below, this temperature the fuel ceases                to exhibit the property of a liquid.                 Pour Point                The stage at which fuel attains its lowest temperature and remains fluid is known as the pour point.                      o                It is 3 C higher than the temperature at which fuel will just flow under its own weight at standard                test conditions.                 Flash Point                This is the lowest temperature at which fuel ignites by a spark or flame.  Flash point of fuel is                usually tested in the laboratories under given test condition by an apparatus known as Abal-Pensky                for fuel or the Cleveland flash point for lubricating oil.                 Fire Point                The fire point is the minimum temperature of a fuel being heated at which the fuel vapours ignite                upon contact with a flame and continue to burn for a period of at least 5 seconds.  The fire point is                        o                15 – 23 C higher than the flash point.  These temperatures determine the classification of fuel for                safety  purposes  and  provide  basis  for  selection  of  pumping  and  storage  facilities,  and  during                bunkering in ships and at fuel depots                 Auto-Ignition Temperature                The process  of combustion  in  diesel  engine starts  with  self-ignition  of the air-fuel  mixture. The                lowest temperature at which a given mixture of fuel and air ignites without any external source of                ignition is known as auto or self-ignition temperature.                        .                  6.2.3    Chemical Composition                Most  common  fuels  whether  in  solid  (coal),  liquid  (petroleum)  or  gaseous  (methane  or  LPG)                consist mainly of hydrogen and carbon.

Some of the                properties  influenced  by  the  chemical  composition  are  the  ignition  quality  and  the  viscosity  at                atmospheric temperature.                 Petroleum  fuels  are  compound  of  a  large  number  of  different  hydrocarbons.  The  common                hydrocarbons are classified according to their chemical structure as follows:                 (a) The Paraffins                These hydrocarbons have molecular formula of the form C H    2n+2 .

It is a major                constituent of natural gas.  Other fuels in this family are ethane (C H ), propane, (C H ), butane                                                                                   2  6              3  8                (C H ) etc.                   4  10                 (b)  Olefins (Alkanes)                They  are unsaturated hydrocarbon  with  formula  -  C H   and have a chain structure with  double                                                                       2n                                                                    n                bonding in the chain structure between carbon atoms.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 77","their  molecular  structure.    Most  hydrocarbons  that  have  more  than  six  carbon  atoms  in  their                molecular structure at normal atmospheric pressures and temperatures are liquid fuels.                 The fuels used in internal combustion engines are a mixture of simple fuels. Diesel fuel contains                numerous hydrocarbons with complex molecular structure. The hydrocarbon constituent depends                on the composition of the crude oil and the refining processes, since crude oil vary significantly in                its  physical  characteristics,  especially  its  viscosity  which  determines  the  percentage  of  distillate                components.    Though  it  contains  mainly  hydrocarbon,  there  are  some  quantities  of  sulphur,                nitrogen, oxygen and minute amount of vanadium and nickel.                 6.2.4  Fuel Analysis                For solid and liquid fuels the analysis is usually quoted as a percentage by weight of each chemical                element in the fuel and it is therefore termed an ultimate or mass analysis. The analysis of gaseous                fuel on the other hand is usually given in terms of percentage by volume of each gas or types of                hydrocarbon present.  The combustible elements are mainly carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).  The                incombustibles present are nitrogen, moisture and ash.                 6.3    Chemistry of Combustion                During combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in internal combustion engines, the carbon molecules burn                to carbon dioxide while the hydrogen combines with oxygen from the charge air to form moisture.                In the diesel engine, exhaust gas analysis indicates that only very small amounts of unburnt fuel and                partly burnt fuel in the form of carbon monoxide exist.                 6.3.1   Chemical Reaction                Chemical reaction is the process in which the inter atomic bonds in 'reactant' molecules are broken                and  atoms  which  are  set  free  rearrange  to  form  new  molecular  combination  called  'product'                molecules.  This process causes a change in the chemical properties of a system. This particular                class of chemical reaction of fuel is called combustion and the products are mainly oxides.                 The first step in the description of a combustion process is the formulation of chemical equation                which shows how the atoms of the reactants are rearranged to form the products.   it is necessary to                know the number of atoms of each element in the molecules of the reactants and the products. A                chemical equation expresses the principles of the conservation of mass in terms of the conservation                of atoms.  A complete combustion of carbon and oxygen to carbon dioxide is:                                                 C   +   O     →    CO                                                          (6-3)                                                          2                                              2                                          Reactants           Product                 In equation (6-3), one atom of carbon combines with one molecule of oxygen (2 atoms of O) to                produce one molecule of carbon dioxide (1 atom of C + 2 atoms of O).  Note that the number of                atoms on each side of the equation is the same.

Due  to  the  complex                combustion process in the diesel engine, the very short time available does not allow for perfect                mixing of fuel and  air.   Thus heterogeneous mixture is  normally  achieved in  diesel  combustion                process. The more fuel that can be burnt for a given amount of air within smoke limit the greater the                power output.  Hence, the excess air utilization in the diesel engine is an important design factor.

In  diesel                engines, the injection system which supplies fuel is an integral part of the engine. For maximum                thermal efficiency, it is essential that the engine be provided with fuel in quantities proportional in                the smallest degree to the power required within the limit of operation and each injection of fuel be                timed with the utmost accuracy.                 The function of the  fuel injection pump  is  to  meter and deliver the  correct  quantity of fuel  and                discharge it through an orifice of an injector nozzle at a high pressure such that fuel is atomised and                delivered into the combustion chamber in a form which will enable it to ignite and burn rapidly to                achieve complete combustion.                 As this process may be repeated several times in a minute, injection equipment are designed with                high precision. A successful operation of such equipment however, depends first and foremost on                high degree of cleanliness of the fuel.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 87","The  fuel  injection  pump  delivers  fuel  at  high  pressure  to  the  injector  nozzle  and  enters  the                combustion chamber at a high degree of atomisation and to ensure that sufficient fuel is available                for combustion during the power cycle of the engine. In a multi-cylinder engine, the quantity of fuel                metered, the period and timing of injection must be accurate to ensure even distribution of power                between cylinders and avoid vibration. In addition, the fuel-air mixture, timing and period, control                the  rate  of  combustion  and  heat  release  pattern,  power  and  combustion  noise.  The  fuel  spray                characteristics vary with injector type, engine speed and load. The Bosch and C.A.V injectors are                widely used in varying shapes and sizes but all have the same basic components. Other types are                Detroit and Caterpillar injectors. A cross section of a typical injector is shown in Fig. 7-2.                                                                                                Fig.7-2:  A typical injector                 7.2.1  Injector Nozzles                The nozzle consists of two main parts; nozzle valve and nozzle body. The nozzle valve takes the                form of a plunger which is accurately lapped into the body to the closest possible tolerance within                which it works freely. Due to this fine tolerance the nozzle valve and the nozzle body are always                treated as a pair and never interchanged. Fuel is fed to the tip of the nozzle through small holes                drilled vertically in the nozzle body, which terminates in an annular reservoir just above the valve                seating. The top face of body is a lapped mirror finish and carries an annular groove. The vertical                drillings lead from this groove to the reservoir. A hole or holes at the tip of the nozzle body allows                fuel to pass into the combustion chamber in a very fine spray. Some types of nozzles are shown in                Fig. 7-3.                    Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 88","Fig.7-3: Some types of nozzles                  (a) Single hole nozzle                 The single hole nozzle has one hole drilled through its body which is closed by the nozzle valve.                 (b) Multi-hole nozzle                The Multi-hole nozzle can have a varying number of holes drilled in the bulbous end under the                valve seating. Their actual number and size depends on the engine requirements.                 (c) Long Stem Nozzle                This  type  of  nozzle  is  used  with  direct  injection  engine  where,  owing  to  limited  space  between                valves in the cylinder head, it is not possible to provide adequate cooling for the standard short stem                nozzle. It is an alternative form of nozzle with a small diameter extension having a tip provided                with the usual valve seating and dome for the injection holes. The valve stem is elongated and fits                in the nozzle's body.                 Continued operation in the hot environment leads to carbon deposits forming on the nozzle body                and sometimes in the hole. The nozzle valves can also become lacquered and sluggish in operation.                Hence injectors need to be serviced regularly.                 7.2.2  Nozzle Holder                The lower portion of a nozzle holder is threaded externally and an internal threaded cap nut with a                collar formed on the outside of the nozzle body is screwed to the holder, retaining the nozzle in                position. The lower end of the holder has a lapped mirror finish face similar to the upper face of the                nozzle body and when in position makes a high pressure joint. The holder is bored internally and                carries  a  loose  fitting  spindle  while  the  lower  end  rests  on  the  stalk  of  the  nozzle  valve  which                protrudes inside the bore. A spring bears on the top end of the spindle and is enclosed by a bridge                piece screwed into the holder. An adjustment screw with locknut is threaded into the bridge piece                for altering the tension of the spring. The bridge piece is enclosed by a protection cap screwed onto                it. A fuel inlet connection is threaded externally to receive a piping, and a vertical drilling in the                holder leads to the annular groove on the face of the nozzle body. The injector is secured in the                cylinder head by studs and nuts or clamps. A gas tight joint is made by a cooper washer between the                face of the cap nut and the cylinder head.                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 89","7.2.3  Fuel Injection Sequence                Fuel  at  high  pressure  is  fed  from  the  injection  pump  through  the  drilling  in  the  holder,  via  the                annular groove and drillings in the nozzle body to the reservoir as shown in Fig. 7.2. The nozzle                valve  is  raised  from  its  seat  by  the  fuel  pressure  acting  on  the  differential  area  formed  by  the                reduced diameter, overcoming the spring tension, and the fuel is forced through the holes as a fine                spray  into  the  combustion  chamber.  When  the  pump  cuts  off  the  fuel  supply,  the  pressure  falls                rapidly  and  the  spring  returns  the  nozzle  valve  to  its  seat.  A  slight  leakage  of  fuel  takes  place                between the nozzle valve body and the holder around the internal bore and lubricates the valve.                Excess fuel is led away via the leak off connection and piping.                 The type of nozzles to be used is determined by the engine manufacturers and it depends on the                particular requirement of the engine performance and the combustion chamber. Since nozzle design                varies considerably with respect to its diameter, length, spray angle valve lift, etc. It is essential that                only the specified nozzles are used in service.                 7.2.4  Matching Injection Nozzle to Connecting Pipe                When pumping of fuel starts a pressure wave is propagated throughout the fuel line up to the nozzle                valve. The speed of the wave is approximately that of sound in the fuel and is expressed as:                                                         K                                                            V  2  =                                                                        (7-1)                                                                                 Where:                        V      = velocity of the wave                            K   = bulk modulus of the fuel oil                              = fuel density                Using the values of K = 1482MPa and  = 825 kg/m , the speed of propagation of the pressure is                                                                     3                approximately 1340 m/s.                 The pressure-flow characteristics to the pipe between the pump and injector differ from that of the                nozzle holes under high pressure injection system. In marine diesel engine where variable engine                operation exists, the pipe diameter must be selected to give the best compromise between the high                and low speed operations.

Its function is                to  deliver  fuel  to  the  injectors  in  precise  quantities,  at  high  pressure  and  at  the  exact  time  it  is                required in the cylinder. Also, it must be made to vary the amount of fuel according to the speed                and load of the engine.                 There are two types of injection pumps in use, both are basically hydro-mechanical.  The one most                commonly used is the jerk pump system. In this system, a separate injection pump is provided for                each cylinder which operates in every power stroke. The barrel and plunger together with the cam                are dimensioned to displace fuel at the rate it is required in the combustion chamber.                 7.3.1   Jerk Type Fuel Pumps                                                                 Fig. 7-4: Section of a typical jerk fuel pump                These pumps deliver fuel at a pressure which is sufficiently high to cause the spring loaded nozzle                valve of the injector to lift and force fuel through an orifice drilled at the end of a nozzle body (Fig.                7-4). The pressure of this fuel is such that atomisation is caused by the velocity of the discharging                   Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 91","jet relative to that of the compressed air in the combustion chamber. Fuel pumps as generally fitted                to marine diesel engines are of the spring-return plunger type.                 Operation                The plunger of a fuel pump is actuated by a cam and roller tappet follower.  When the follower is                on the heel of the cam the plunger is at the bottom of its stroke and the inlet port in the barrel is                uncovered allowing fuel in the gallery which surrounds the barrel to flow into and fill that portion                of the barrel above the plunger, Fig. 7-5 (a).  The plunger is a close fit within the barrel made of                special steel or cast iron.  As the cam rotates the plunger rises and seals off the inlet ports, and at                this point of the stroke the pumping action starts. Further upward movement of the plunger causes                the fuel pressure to rise and expelled through the delivery valve to the injector.                                                                               d                                                 Fig.7-5: Principle of fuel metering                 A helical groove extends from the top of the plunger partway down its cylindrical surface. Angular                positioning of the plunger about its axis, will locate this groove in relation to the inlet port to give                the  required  quantity  of  fuel  per  stroke-position  (b).  In  some  designs,  a  separate  spill  port  is                provided  but  this  is  also  made  to  communicate  with  the  inlet  gallery.  Effective  delivery  of  fuel                continues  until  the  plunger  reaches  position  (c),  when  the  lower  edge  of  the  control  helix  has                uncovered the spill port in the barrel, thus allowing fuel to spill back to the inlet gallery of the pump                which is at lower pressure than that inside of the barrel. This allows the delivery valve to close and                stop further delivery and the unloaded volume of fuel is passed back to the inlet gallery.                 The plunger stroke is always constant but that part of it which is actually pumping is variable, by                means of rotating the plunger to vary the stroke between port closure and port opening. Position (d)                of Fig. 7-5 represents full load output whereas position (e) shows the idling condition. To stop the                engine, the plunger is turned to a position so that the vertical slot is opposite the port and all the                displaced fuel is spilled back to the inlet gallery, as shown in position (f).                 The amount of fuel delivered will vary in accordance with the distance separating the top of the                plunger and the helix relative to the spill port. This angular position is controlled by a rack and                pinion,  the  latter  forming  a  sleeve  having  an  axial  slot  or  slots  to  receive  a  projection  on  the                plunger. The rack position therefore determines the quantity of fuel supplied. The plunger is a close                fit within the barrels  to  ensure sealing at  high pressure.  However, some leakage is  necessary to                provide lubrication for the relative movement.                       Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 92","The timing of the injection is controlled by the instant that the pump plunger closes the inlet port.                The instant can be adjusted by raising or lowering the plunger with reference to the cam. Raising                the level of the plunger will advance the point of injection.                 7.3.2   Fuel Injection Pump (Caterpillar type)                The Caterpillar fuel pump as shown in  Fig.  7-6 has  \"V' type of housing which is similar to the                engine cylinder block. It has equal number of pump elements as the cylinders on each bank.. The                rotation of the camshaft (12) causes lifters (9) and pump plungers (5) to move up and down. The                stroke of each pump plunger is always the same and the force of the springs (6) acts against the cam                lobes of the camshaft through the cam followers.

As the plunger moves up, it closes the inlet passage and                the pressure of the fuel in the chamber above the plunger increases until it is high enough to cause                check valve (3) to open. Fuel under high pressure flows out of the check valve through the fuel line                to the injection valve until the inlet passage opens into pressure relief passage (4) in the plunger.                The pressure in the chamber thereby decreases and the check valve (3) closes.   When the longer                inlet passage (2) is closed, larger amount of fuel is forced through the check valve (3). The period                for which the inlet passage is closed is controlled by pressure relief passage (4). The design of the                passage makes it possible to change the inlet passage closure time by rotation of the plunger. When                the governor moves the fuel racks (8), the gears (7) that are fastened to plungers (5) also move and                rotate the plungers.                        Engr.

It is designed to withdraw a small amount of fuel from this                pipe as it closes. This causes the pressure at the injector to fall more rapidly than would otherwise                be the case, thus providing a sharp end to the injection and helping the injector needle to re-seat                without causing dribble at the nozzle holes. This action is brought about by a piston portion formed                on the valve as shown in Fig.7-7. The clearance between this piston and the bore in the body should                be maintained when reconditioning delivery valves.                  7.5     Electronic Fuel Injection System                               Unit Pump                                  Unit Injector                           Engine              HP Fuel Line                          Fuel Rack                         Control                         Unit                                                                 Actuator                                 Fuel Supply                      HP Fuel Line       Fuel Supply                                 Fuel Rack           Injector                        Actuator                                                              Engine                                                                                              Control                                                                              Injector        Unit                                      Fig. 7-8(a): Conventional injection systems with electronic control                 The  conventional  fuel  injection  systems  with  mechanical  actuation  include  in-line  pumps,  unit                pumps with short high pressure fuel lines and unit injectors-Fig.7-8(a).

The pressure in a                unit pump is lower than that in a unit injector but because of the dynamic pressure increase in the                high pressure fuel line, a mean injector pressure of over 1000bar can be achieved with less stress in                the unit pump. Investigation has shown that with a unit injector, the maximum sac pressure was                1670bar about 60bar higher than in the unit pump system.

To produce minimum                fuel injection quantity, extremely short shift period and accuracy can be achieved to ensure good                engine speed control.  Actuation of the individual solenoid valves, engine speed control and fuel                injection limitation, are effected by a microprocessor-controlled engine control unit – Fig. 7-8(b).                Optimal adjustment and individual cylinder fuel injection calibration and injection timing are thus                possible with the injection period being specified and realized for each injection phase. Individual                cylinder cut-out control is performed by the electronic control unit.                 With cam-controlled injection systems, the injection pressure is dependent on the pump speed and                the amount of fuel injected. For engines with high BMEPs in the lower speed and low load ranges,                this  characteristic  is  disadvantageous  to  the  automation  process  as  the  injection  pressure  drops                rapidly. Adjusting the injection timing also influences the in-system pressure build-up, e.g. if timing                is advanced, the solenoid valve closes earlier, fuel compression  starts at a lower speed thus leading                to lower injection pressures which in turn is detrimental to mixture preparation. Thus to achieve                higher  injection  pressures  extremely  steep  cam  configurations  are  required.    Hence  while  the                solenoid valve-controlled system has a number of advantages, it retains some of the disadvantages                of the conventional system.

Each injector is actuated in sequence by the ECU as a                function of the crank angle. The injector opens when energized and closes when de-energized. The                amount of fuel injected per cycle is determined by the time differential and the in-system pressure.                The actual in-system pressure is transmitted to the control unit via a pressure sensor and the rail                pressure is regulated by the ECU via the actuator in the fuel supply to the high pressure pump.                 With  this  system  the  injector  incorporates  several  functions.  The  nozzle  needle  is  relieved  by  a                solenoid value and thus opened by the fuel pressure. The amount of fuel injected during the ignition                delay period is regulated by the nozzle opening speed. After the control valve is de-energised and                additionally  hydraulic  valve  is  activated  which  ensures  rapid  closure  of  the  nozzle  needle  and,                therefore,  minimum  smoke  index.  With  this  servo-assisted  injector,  the  opening  and  closing                characteristics  can  be  adjusted  individually  and  affected  extremely  precisely.  It  is  capable  of                extremely  high  reaction  speeds  for  controlling  minimum  fuel  quantities  during  idling  or  pilot                injection.                 Compared  to  a  conventional  injection  system,  the  pumping  force  is  considerably  lower,  with                pressure generation accomplished by a multi-cylinder, radial-piston pump driven by an eccentric                cam. Pressure control is realized by restricting the supply flow. Locating the high-pressure pump on                the  crankcase  presents  no  problems  while  the  fuel  injection  control  cams  are  deleted  from  the                camshaft which can therefore be dimensioned accordingly.                 The rail system is required to supply all injectors with fuel at an identical pressure and its design is                based  on  criteria  such  as  minimum  fuel  injection  quantity  deviations  between  cylinders,  faster                pressure build-up after start and minimum pressure loss from the rail to the nozzle sac. With the                common rail injection system the ECU determines the engine speed and calculates the amount of                fuel to be injected, based on the difference between actual and pre-set engine speed. The individual                injectors are energised as a function of crankshaft angle and firing order. Control of the common                rail in-system pressure is also by the ECU.

YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 96","conventional injection system, as regards speed control due to the improve actuator dynamic, can                also be applied to the same extent to the common rail system; at the moment of each injection, the                governor-generated data can be immediately processed.                 With  common  rail  injection  the  complete  system  is  permanently  subjected  to  extremely  high                pressure and its regulation is very effective. In the event of the failure of a single injector the engine                is protected in that the injector is cut-off from the fuel supply by the fuel stop valve and no fuel can                enter  the  combustion  chamber.  The  engine  can,  however,  still  be  operated  at  reduced  power.  A                mechanical pressure relief valve is activated if, due to a pressure regulating system malfunction, the                pressure rise to an unacceptable level. Leaks in the system are identified by the pressure monitoring                system.                  7.8    Governing and Governors                 7.8.1   Overview                The load and speed of operation of an internal combustion engine depend on the amount of fuel                supplied. In case of the diesel engine, the amount of fuel injected is determined by the position of                the fuel pump control rack while the load will depend on the engine application. Governors in use                range  from  simple  mechanical  governors  to  the  latest  integrated  electronic  control  systems.  As                marine diesel engines have become more complex and operational requirements more stringent, the                governing systems have also become very complicated to meet the demands.                 Engine designed for generators must run at a constant speed under varying load conditions. Manual                movement of the control rack of the fuel pump frequently to compensate for load changes would be                an arduous if not an impossible task. Some device must be fitted, therefore to adjust the amount of                fuel supplied automatically and hence maintain a steady engine speed. This device is known as a                governor.  Propulsion  engines  are  not  subject  to  frequent  load  changes  and  governors  are  fitted                mainly to achieve fine control. Governing control must accurately achieve a stable and satisfactory                engine operating conditions.                 7.8.2    Basic Principle of Governing                A governor is in effect an automatic control device. It's action is to sense an 'error' between the                'desired engine speed' and the 'actual engine speed' and move the fuel rack to a new position and                enable the engine to cope with this error. To achieve this, a mechanism must measure the 'error' and                another one moves the fuel rack to the new 'position'.                 A clear distinction between the function of a governor and an over speed trip is necessary. Diesel                engines driving electrical generators may use plain fly weight governors. Thus a change in speed                results in variation of the position of the fly weight and alteration of fuel supply. Some large slow                diesel  engines  are  fitted  with  an  over  speed  trip.  The  trip  allows  normal  fuel  under  the  desired                operating condition but in the event of speed rising above a set value, fuel supply cut off until the                speed drops to normal again. If the speed increase exceeds a certain set value, the trip will stay                locked until it is reset manually.                      Engr. YS Akpaba                                                                          Page 97","7.8.3   The Closed Loop Control                                        GOVERNOR                             ENGINE                                      Servo-power                          Fuel Injection                                       Amplifier                             Pump                                      Speed Measuring                      Diesel Engine                                        Device                                                     Load                                                  Fig. 7-10: Basic closed-loop controls                 The whole system can be regarded as a closed loop control. Fig.7-10 shows the basic arrangement                in  block  form.  A  load  increase  would  cause  a  momentary  'speed  droop'.  The  speed  measuring                device would obtain a measured value signal from the diesel and compare this with a desired value                from the speed setting control. The deviation would be converted into an output that would bring                into action the servo-power amplifier which would position the fuel rack and increase the supply of                fuel to meet the increase in load.                 Since the speed measuring device does not have to position the fuel rack, it can be very responsive                thus minimising the time delay between load and fuel alteration in the closed loop. A servo-power                amplifier is usually a hydraulic device that quickly and effectively provides the necessary power to                move the fuel rack.                 The above closed loop control can achieve a stable and satisfactory operation since fluctuation in                the load can be compensated by the adjustment in engine speed. Thus disturbance made in the loop                will travel round the loop to the engine e.g. changes in load or speed setting.                 7.8.4   Simple Mechanical Hydraulic Governor                                                      Fig.7-11: Mechanical hydraulic governor (Proportional action)                   Engr.

The centrifugal speed measuring                unit is fitted with a conical shaped spring; this gives a spring rate that varies with the square of the                speed.  It gives linearity to the speed measuring system i.e. the response is directly proportional to                the change in speed.

The                piston in the servo amplifier will move up and actuate the fuel rack to increase fuel supply to the                engine. The feedback link reduces the force in the speeder spring so that the fly weights can move                outwards to a new position thus raising the pilot valve and closing off the oil supply. If for some                reasons,  the  pressure  in  the  oil  supply  system  falls  then  the  spring  loaded  piston  in  the  servo                cylinder will move down and the fuel to the engine cut off. This is called 'fail safe'. Any oil that                leaks past the servo-piston will be drained off to the oil sump tank If not the servo-piston would                eventually lock in position.                 7.8.5   Governor with Proportional and Reset Action.

Note:  Speed drop that took place during the change of the relative positions of the two pistons was                transient.  This  type  of  governor  that  has  proportional  and  rest  action  is  called  an  'Isochronous                governor'.                 7.8.6  Over Speed Trip                In addition to the speed regulation governor, it is usual to provide an over speed trip to safeguard                against  any  accidental  running  away  of  the  engine.  This  is  essential  in  the  case  of  installations                having clutches in the drive which allow the engine to be disconnected from the propeller.

The arrangement is unstable in the sense that the bolt cannot                return even though the speed should fall somewhat, and this is an added safeguard. The bolt in its                'out' position strike a latch which releases a plunger which shuts off the fuel supply to the engine.                The mechanism has to be manually reset before the engine can be started again.                 7.8.7  Basic Governing Terms                 (a) Speed Droop                                                                  Fig.7-15: Speed droop characteristics                 In governing, the term speed droop or just droop is used to define the change in speed between no                load and full load conditions.  On board a ship two or three generators can run and be connected in                parallel to a control system while each generator retains its own speed droop.  Since an increase in                servo position is  required if an engine is  to  carry  more load, it follows  that an increase in  load                would decrease the speed. Droop is expressed as a % change in speed corresponding to the full                travel of the servo.                 Speed droop provides stability and is also necessary when two or more engines fitted with speed                sensing governors are operating in parallel mechanically or electrically to share load proportionally.                Fig.7-15  shows  the  speed  droop  characteristics  with  different  droop  settings  and  illustrates  the                effect of a  speed rise due to load decrease on parallel unit A, (2% droop) and Unit B, (6% droop).

Each  curve  has  a                different speed setting for a change in the servo position or rated power output.                 Steady-state speed regulation is a governing speed characteristic which decreases with increase in                power output of the prime mover or of the driven load. It is expressed as the percentage change in                speed corresponding to the change from zero to full power output. It also provides stability and load                division.

(d)  Transient Performance                The quality of transient performance is often measured on the basis of speed deviation, momentary                over speed, recovery time, response time and  damping factor in  response to  step change.

It  is  a  variable  range  governor  and                consists basically two or four flyweights (49) on a hub fitted at the end of the camshaft (71). A                sliding sleeve fork is supported by a ball bearing in the sleeve. The longer arm of the crank lever is                connected by a telescopic link (17), the shorter arm is connected by the governor springs (159) and                (167) to the speed lever shaft (122). The engine speed is controlled by the spring tension applied                through the operation of the speed lever (120). When the speed lever is moved to a higher speed                position, the control rod is moved accordingly towards the maximum fuel delivery position while at                the same time the sliding sleeve is moved against the toes of the flyweight to close the flyweights.                                                                       Fig. 7-19: Typical governor of high speed engines                 When  the  engine  speed  increases  just  above  the  selected  speed  the  centrifugal  force  of  the                flyweights  acting on the crank lever, moves the control rod towards the minimum fuel position,                thereby reducing the fuel delivery and hence engine speed. Consequently as the setting of the speed                lever remains unchanged, the tension in the governor springs moves the control rod to the selected                speed position. This completes the cycle of operation.                  Engr.
